# svelte-rust-boilerplate

A quick boilerplate to write [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app using [Warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp), a Rust web framework as the backend. The Svelte app is bundled with [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/). It also uses Snowpack's dev proxy capability to proxy request during development to dev server.

# Development

To run the code in development, execute the following command

```
yarn run dev:server
yarn run dev:client
```

Server will run in port 3030.
Client app will run in port 8080.
