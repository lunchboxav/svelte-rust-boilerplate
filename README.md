# svelte-rust-boilerplate

A quick boilerplate to write Svelte app using Warp, a Rust web framework as the backend. The Svelte app is bundled with Snowpack. It also uses Snowpack's dev proxy capability to proxy request during development to dev server.

# Development

To run the code in development, execute the following command

```
yarn run dev:server
yarn run dev:client
```

Server will run in port 3030.
Client app will run in port 8080.
